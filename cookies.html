<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
<li>200g dairy free margarine</li>
<li>125g soft light brown sugar</li>
<li>100g caster sugar</li>
<li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li>250g plain flour</li>
<li>½ tsp baking powder</li>
<li>½ tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
<li>pinch of salt</li>
<li>200g vegan dark chocolate chips</li>
<li>1 tbsp soya milk</li>

<h3>Method:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4 and line two baking trays with baking paper.</li>
<li>Tip the dairy-free margarine, both sugars and the vanilla extract into a large bowl (or bowl of a free-
standing mixer). Sift the flour, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and a pinch of salt into the bowl and
beat everything until thoroughly combined and almost smooth.</li>
<li>Add the chocolate chips and soya milk and mix again until the chocolate chips are thoroughly incorporated.</li>
<li>Use an ice cream scoop or two dessertspoons to drop neat mounds of dough onto the lined baking trays
allowing plenty of space between each cookie as they will spread during cooking. Bake for about 10
minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
<li>Remove from the oven and leave to cool on the baking trays.</li>
